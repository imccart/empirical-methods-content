## Outline for Today

1. Quality Disclosure in Economics
2. Background on MA Star Ratings
3. Quality *Disclosure* and Plan Choice

# Quality Disclosure

## Hidden quality

- Many goods have unobserved quality (e.g., used cars, hospitals, schools, mutual funds)
- Asymmetric information implies potential **adverse selection** and market shrinkage
- Quality disclosure tools: ratings, report cards, warranties, online reviews, certifications


## Lemons logic

- Sellers know quality; buyers only know the distribution of quality
- Buyers pay price based on expected quality of sellers who accept a given price
- With lower prices, high-quality sellers exit, expected quality falls, prices decline further
- High-quality firms cannot sufficiently relay information on quality, so only low-quality “lemons” may remain

## Voluntary disclosure and “unraveling”

- Assume each seller can **credibly** disclose their own quality at low cost
- If a good-quality seller stays silent, buyers suspect they’re like the **worst** silent type
- Slightly better types want to separate by disclosing
- Result: almost all types disclose; **silence = bad news**


## Why full unraveling may fail

- Disclosure is costly (data collection, audits, risk adjustment)
- Information is noisy or complex; buyers may not understand it
- Quality is multi-dimensional; firms highlight strong metrics, hide weak ones
- Outcome: **partial disclosure** and strategic framing instead of full unraveling


## Evidence from report cards

- Cardiac surgery and hospital report cards:
  - Higher-rated providers often gain volume but may avoid sicker patients or focus on scored outcomes
- Restaurant hygiene grades:
  - Public scores push restaurants to improve measured cleanliness and reduce violations
- Overall: disclosure changes both **demand** (patient choice) and **supply** (quality effort and selection)


## Policy lessons

- Well-designed disclosure can:
  - Reduce adverse selection and reward high quality
  - Strengthen competition on performance, not just price or brand
- Poorly designed disclosure can:
  - Encourage cream-skimming and metric gaming
- Key design choices: which outcomes, how risk-adjusted, and how information is presented to users


# Medicare Advantage Quality Ratings

## Overview

- Initial MA Star Ratings (2007)
- Overall rating introduced in 2009
- Complicated formula...

::: {.fragment}
- **key point:** ratings from several domains are averaged and then rounded
- More details available [here](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Prescription-Drug-Coverage/PrescriptionDrugCovGenIn/PerformanceData)
:::


## Role of Quality Ratings

- Potentially affect plan choice
- Quality bonus program in 2012
  - Demonstration program at first (2012 through 2015)
  - ACA quality bonus payments begin 2015
  

## Details of QBP

Eligible plans may receive two bonuses:

1. Benchmark bonus: Increased benchmark payment of up to 5\%
2. Rebate bonus: Share of bid-benchmark differential going back to insurer (from 50% up to 70%)


::: {.fragment}
- Applied to plans with 3-stars and above from 2012-2015 (demonstration period)
- Applied to plans with 4-stars and above beginning 2015

# Quality Ratings and Plan Choice


## Quality Ratings as Information Disclosure

- Health insurance is a complicated product with many dimensions
- Strong empirical evidence of "bad" choices in health insurance
- Quality disclosure might help consumers make better choices


## Disclosure versus Quality

- We are interested in the effects of **disclosure**, not just quality ratings themselves
- Correlation between ratings and enrollments will combine the disclosure effect as well as the "higher quality" effect
- Our RD design will exploit differential reporting but for otherwise very similiar underlying quality
