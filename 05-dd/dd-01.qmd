## Background

1. What percent of people are uninsured?

```{r}
#| code-fold: TRUE
#| code-summary: "R Code"

ins.dat <- read_tsv("../data/input/processed/acs_medicaid.txt")

ins.dat <- ins.dat %>%
  mutate(perc_private = (ins_employer + ins_direct)/adult_pop,
         perc_public = (ins_medicare + ins_medicaid)/adult_pop,
         perc_ins = (adult_pop - uninsured)/adult_pop,
         perc_unins = uninsured/adult_pop,
         perc_employer = ins_employer/adult_pop,
         perc_medicaid = ins_medicaid/adult_pop,
         perc_medicare = ins_medicare/adult_pop,
         perc_direct = ins_direct/adult_pop)

ins.dat %>% group_by(year) %>% summarize(mean=mean(perc_unins)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=mean)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x="Year",
    y="Fraction Uninsured",
    title="Share of Uninsured over Time"
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=2013.5, color="red")
```


## Background

1. What percent of people are uninsured?

2. How do people get health insurance?

```{r}
#| code-fold: TRUE
#| code-summary: "R Code"

ins.dat %>%
  filter(year==2012) %>% pivot_longer(c("perc_employer","perc_direct","perc_medicaid")) %>%
  select(State, name, value) %>%
  group_by(name) %>% summarize(mean=mean(value)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=name, y=mean)) +
  geom_col() + ylim(0,0.65) + 
  labs(
    x="Source of Insurance",
    y="Percent",
    title="Source of Health Insurance in 2012"
  ) + theme_bw() + scale_x_discrete(labels=c('perc_direct'='Direct Purchase',
                                             'perc_employer'='Employer-provided',
                                             'perc_medicaid'='Medicaid'))
```


## Employer provided insurance

The U.S. still relies heavily on private insurance provided by employers. 

::: {.fragment}
Any thoughts on why?
:::


## Employer provided insurance

1. Stabalization act of 1942 (wages frozen but not benefits)

2. Tax exclusion for insurance expenditures (1954)


## How did the ACA change things?

- Create health insurance exchanges
    - Individual mandate (since set to $0)
    - Premium and cost-sharing subsidies (some unpaid by Trump administration)
    - Insurance subsidies (removed before intended)
    - Decision assistance
    - Minimum benefits and community ratings
- Stay on parent's plan to 26


## How did the ACA change things?

- Medicaid Expansion
    - Originally tied to federal funding
    - Made voluntary by supreme court ruling
    - Higher initial federal match rate, decreasing over time
- Pay-for-performance measures
    - Hospital value-based purchasing
    - Hospital readmission reduction
    - Medicare Advantage quality improvement program
    - Bundled payments and ACOs (related)

## Change in Insurance Type over Time

```{r}
#| code-fold: TRUE
#| code-summary: "R Code"

## Count of plans by type (across years)
mean.dat <- ins.dat %>%
  pivot_longer(c("perc_employer","perc_direct","perc_medicaid", "perc_medicare")) %>%
  select(State, name, value, year) %>%
  group_by(name, year) %>% summarize(mean=mean(value)) %>% ungroup()

mean.dat <- mean.dat %>%
  mutate(name = as.factor(name)) %>%
  mutate(name = fct_recode(name,
                           "Direct Purchase" = "perc_direct",
                           "Employer-provided" = "perc_employer",
                           "Medicaid" = "perc_medicaid",
                           "Medicare" = "perc_medicare"))

plot_ly(mean.dat,
        y=~name, 
        x=~mean, 
        frame=~as.factor(year), 
        type='bar',
        width=800,
        height=400) %>%
  animation_slider(
    currentvalue = list(prefix = "Year ", font = list(color="blue"))
  ) %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Fraction of Population"), 
         yaxis = list(title = ""))
```


## Uninsurance over time

```{r}
#| code-fold: TRUE
#| code-summary: "R Code"

ins.dat %>% group_by(year) %>% summarize(mean=mean(perc_unins)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=mean)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x="Year",
    y="Fraction Uninsured",
    title="Share of Uninsured over Time"
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=2013.5, color="red")
```


## Direct purchase over time

```{r}
#| code-fold: TRUE
#| code-summary: "R Code"

ins.dat %>% group_by(year) %>% summarize(mean=mean(perc_direct)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=mean)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x="Year",
    y="Fraction with Direct Purchase",
    title="Share of Direct Purchase Insurance over Time"
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=2013.5, color="red")
```


## Medicaid over time

```{r}
#| code-fold: TRUE
#| code-summary: "R Code"

ins.dat %>% group_by(year) %>% summarize(mean=mean(perc_medicaid)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=mean)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x="Year",
    y="Fraction with Medicaid",
    title="Share of Medicaid Insurance over Time"
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=2013.5, color="red")
```


## Main takeaways

1. Large reduction in uninsured population following ACA
2. Biggest gains going to direct purchase (exchanges) and Medicaid (expansion)


# Hospital Uncompensated Care

## Defining Uncompensated Care

Uncompensated care is hospital care for which no payment is received. It includes:

- **Charity care:** care provided with an expectation of nonpayment.  
- **Bad debt:** care initially expected to be paid but ultimately unpaid.

Typically measured in **charges or costs**, with accounting practices varying across hospitals

## Measuring Uncompensated Care

In **HCRIS**, uncompensated care is derived from **Medicare cost report accounting**, not patient-level data:

- **Charity care:** reported charges for services designated as charity care, converted to costs using the hospital's cost-to-charge ratio.
- **Bad debt:** unpaid patient obligations *after collection efforts*, net of recoveries; Medicare-reimbursable bad debt is reported separately.
- Reflects accounting definitions and reporting incentives, which may change over time and differ across hospitals


## Revisiting HCRIS Data

```{r}
#| code-fold: TRUE
#| code-summary: "R Code"

hcris.data <- read_csv("../data/output/hcris-snippets/hcris-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    Year = year,
    uncomp_care_m = uncomp_care / 1e6   # millions of dollars
  )

hcris.data %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(
    Mean = mean(uncomp_care_m, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD   = sd(uncomp_care_m,   na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  kbl(
    caption = "Uncompensated Care ($mm)",
    digits = 2,
    align = "c"
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c("condensed"))

```



# Data Overview

## Data sources

We'll use two main data sources here:

- Uncompensated care data from HCRIS
- Medicaid expansion dates by state from *Kaiser Family Foundation*
  - Some background code for working with these data are available [here](https://github.com/imccart-test/insurance-access). Note that this repository covers more than what we use in this class. In our case, we're only working with the KFF Medicaid expansion data.
  - Directly dowload from KFF website (one .csv file) and upload to Open OnDemand if using


## Merging HCRIS and KFF data

- Standard join by state, but KFF data show state name while HCRIS has state abbreviation
- Create crosswalks as follows...

::: {.panel-tabset}

### R
```{r}
#| eval: false
state_xwalk <- tibble(
  state_abb  = state.abb,
  state_name = state.name
)

hcris.mcaid <- hcris.data %>%
  left_join(state_xwalk, by = c("state" = "state_abb")) %>%
  left_join(kff.final, by=c("state_name"="state")) %>%
  filter(! state %in% c("DC", "GU", "PR", "MP", "VI"))

```


### Python

```{python}
#| eval: false

import pandas as pd
from us import states

# Build state crosswalk (50 states only, like R's state.abb/state.name)
state_xwalk = pd.DataFrame({
    "state_abb": [s.abbr for s in states.STATES],
    "state_name": [s.name for s in states.STATES]
})

hcris_mcaid = (
    hcris_data
        .merge(state_xwalk, left_on="state", right_on="state_abb", how="left")
        .merge(kff_final, left_on="state_name", right_on="state", how="left")
        .query("state not in ['DC', 'GU', 'PR', 'MP', 'VI']")
)

```

## Descriptive Statistics

```{r}
#| code-fold: TRUE
#| code-summary: "R Code"

hcris.data %>%
  mutate(
    Status = if_else(
      !is.na(date_adopted) & year >= lubridate::year(date_adopted),
      "Expanded",
      "Not Expanded"
    )
  ) %>%
  group_by(Status) %>%
  summarize(
    Mean = mean(uncomp_care_m, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD   = sd(uncomp_care_m,   na.rm = TRUE),
    N    = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>% kbl(
    caption = "Uncompensated Care ($mm)",
    digits = 2
  )

```

## Takeaways

- Large expansions of Medicaid from the ACA
- Reason to expect reduction in uncompensated care for affected hospitals
- Supported by descriptive statistics showing lower uncompensated care after expansion
