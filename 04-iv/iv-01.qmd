# Hospital Prices


## What is a hospital price?

Defining characteristic of hospital services: *it's complicated!*

## What is a hospital price?

Lots of different payers paying lots of different prices:

- [Medicare fee-for-service prices](https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/Downloads/AcutePaymtSysfctsht.pdf)
- [Medicaid payments](https://www.kff.org/report-section/understanding-medicaid-hospital-payments-and-the-impact-of-recent-policy-changes-issue-brief/)
- Private insurance negotiations (including Medicare Advantage)
- But what about the price to patients?

## What is a hospital price?

In most economic discussions, a hospital's "price" refers to the **allowed payment negotiated with insurers**. That's typically the definition I'll use as well.

## Hospital prices in real life

A few empirical facts:

1. Hospital services are expensive
2. Prices vary dramatically across different areas
3. Lack of competition is a major reason for high prices

# Hospital Pay for Performance (P4P)

## Basic Idea

- FFS payments create an incentive to overtreat
- Capitated payments create an incentive to undertreat
- Neither is necessarily a problem unless patient care is adversely affected

## Current P4P Programs

There are three main hospital-based P4P programs in Medicare right now, details available [here](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality/value-based-programs):

1. Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program
2. Hospital Value-based Purchasing Program
3. Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program 

::: {.aside}
Other programs exist for other care settings/services, such as the [Quality Payment Program](https://qpp.cms.gov/about/qpp-overview) for physicians, which includes the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) and Advanced Alternative Payment Models (APMs)
:::

## HRRP

- Reduces Medicare IPPS payments to hospitals with excess 30-day readmission rates for selected conditions (e.g., AMI, HF, pneumonia)
- Penalties are based on risk-adjusted excess readmission ratios relative to national benchmarks and are capped at 3% of base operating DRG payments
- Purely punitive (no bonuses, only penalties)
- Significant debate surrounding risk adjustment and potential unintended consequences
- [HRRP Tracker](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/hospital-penalties/readmissions/)

## VBP Program

- Redistributes Medicare payments across hospitals based on a composite performance score covering clinical outcomes, patient experience (HCAHPS), safety, and efficiency
- Funding is budget-neutral: CMS withholds a fixed percentage of payments from all hospitals and redistributes it based on relative performance, creating both winners and losers
- [VBP Tracker](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/hvbp)

## HAC Reduction Program

- Penalizes hospitals in the worst-performing quartile on patient safety metrics (e.g., infection rates, PSI measures)
- Hospitals in the worst-performing quartile receive a flat 1% reduction in total IPPS payments; there are no bonuses
- Blunt, threshold-based incentive focused squarely on inpatient safety and has raised concerns about measurement noise and weak differentiation among hospitals

# P4P and Pricing

## How?

There are several mechanisms by which P4P programs can influence a hospital's negotiated price with insurers:
- increasing costs
- differentiation (e.g., quality improvement or changes in services)
- service mix
- bargaining

## Costs

- P4P may increase **real operating costs**
  - care coordination
  - discharge planning
  - post-acute management
- If these investments raise costs across all patients, hospitals may seek higher prices from private insurers

## Differentiation

- Efforts to reduce readmissions may reflect **genuine quality improvements**
- Hospitals may position themselves as:
  - lower readmission
  - better coordinated
  - higher value
- Insurers and employers may be willing to pay higher prices for perceived improvements in quality

## Service mix

- Hospitals may adjust:
  - admissions policies
  - intensity of care
  - types of services emphasized
- These responses can change the **average price observed** even if per-service negotiations are unchanged

## Bargaining

- Lowering Medicare margins may change hospitals’ incentives in negotiations:
  - greater urgency to secure favorable commercial contracts
  - less willingness to accept low-price agreements
- Effects depend on relative bargaining power and market structure
- This is a form of "cost-shifting" (although not a mechanical pass-through)

## What is Cost-shifting?

- Some concern that when Medicare lowers payment rates, hospitals may respond with higher prices for private-insurance patients
- Is this possible?
  - No: If hospitals can unilaterally set prices, they would lower prices to get the marginaly lower WTP patients (not relevant in a bargaining context)
  - No: Hospitals must negotiate with insurance companies, and if they could have negotiated a higher rate, they would have done so earlier
  - Yes: If profits enter into a hospital's objective function nonlinearly, then reductions in profit could provide upward pricing pressure
- Policy-makers and hospitals say yes (but for simpler reasons)
- Economists often say no under standard bargaining models, though this depends on assumptions about objectives, constraints, and market structure

## Where we're headed

- Empirical question: do P4P programs affect hospital prices?
- Why might we have an endogeneity problem here?
- What we need to answer this question:
  - Hospital prices
  - Penalty status
  - Some "exogenous" source of variation in penalty status...
