# Introduction to Instrumental Variables

---

## What is instrumental variables

Instrumental Variables (IV) is a way to identify causal effects using variation in treatment particpation that is due to an *exogenous* variable that is only related to the outcome through treatment.


---

## Why bother with IV?

Two reasons to consider IV:

1. Selection on unobservables
2. Reverse causation

::: {.fragment}
Either problem is sometimes loosely referred to as *endogeneity*
:::

---

## Simple example

Consider simple regression equation: $$y = \beta x + \varepsilon (x),$$
where $\varepsilon(x)$ reflects the dependence between our observed variable and the error term.<br>

::: {.fragment}
Simple OLS will yield
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \beta + \frac{d\varepsilon}{dx} \neq \beta$$
:::

---

## What does IV do?

- The regression we want to do, $$y_{i} = \alpha + \delta D_{i} + \gamma A_{i} + \epsilon_{i},$$
where $D_{i}$ is treatment (think of schooling for now) and $A_{i}$ is something like ability.

- $A_{i}$ is unobserved, so instead we run $$y_{i} = \alpha + \beta D_{i} + \epsilon_{i}$$

- From this "short" regression, we don't actually estimate $\delta$. Instead, we get an estimate of $$\beta = \delta + \lambda_{ds}\gamma \neq \delta,$$
where $\lambda_{ds}$ is the coefficient of a regression of $A_{i}$ on $D_{i}$. 

---

## Intuition

IV will recover the "long" regression without observing underlying ability<br>

::: {.fragment}
*IF* our IV satisfies all of the necessary assumptions.
:::

---

## More formally

- We want to estimate $$E[Y_{i} | D_{i}=1] - E[Y_{i} | D_{i}=0]$$

- With instrument $Z_{i}$ that satisfies relevant assumptions, we can estimate this as
$$E[Y_{i} | D_{i}=1] - E[Y_{i} | D_{i}=0] = \frac{E[Y_{i} | Z_{i}=1] - E[Y_{i} | Z_{i}=0]}{E[D_{i} | Z_{i}=1] - E[D_{i} | Z_{i}=0]}$$

- In words, this is effect of the instrument on the outcome ("reduced form") divided by the effect of the instrument on treatment ("first stage")

---

## Derivation

Recall "long" regression: $Y=\alpha + \delta S + \gamma A + \epsilon$.

$$\begin{align}
COV(Y,Z) & = E[YZ] - E[Y] E[Z] \\
         & = E[(\alpha + \delta S + \gamma A + \epsilon)\times Z] - E[\alpha + \delta S + \gamma A + \epsilon)]E[Z] \\
         & = \alpha E[Z] + \delta E[SZ] + \gamma E[AZ] + E[\epsilon Z] \\
         & \hspace{.2in} - \alpha E[Z] - \delta E[S]E[Z] - \gamma E[A] E[Z] - E[\epsilon]E[Z] \\
         & = \delta (E[SZ] - E[S] E[Z]) + \gamma (E[AZ] - E[A] E[Z]) \\
         & \hspace{.2in} + E[\epsilon Z] - E[\epsilon] E[Z] \\
         & = \delta C(S,Z) + \gamma C(A,Z) + C(\epsilon, Z)
\end{align}$$

---

## Derivation

Working from $COV(Y,Z) = \delta COV(S,Z) + \gamma COV(A,Z) + COV(\epsilon,Z)$, we find

$$\delta = \frac{COV(Y,Z)}{COV(S,Z)}$$

if $COV(A,Z)=COV(\epsilon, Z)=0$

## IVs in practice

Easy to think of in terms of randomized controlled trial...

## What is IV *really* doing

Think of IV as two-steps:

1. Isolate variation due to the instrument only (not due to endogenous stuff)
2. Estimate effect on outcome using only this source of variation

---

## In regression terms

Interested in estimating $\delta$ from $y_{i} = \alpha + \beta x_{i} + \delta D_{i} + \varepsilon_{i}$, but $D_{i}$ is endogenous (no pure "selection on observables").

::: {.fragment}
- **Step 1:** With instrument $Z_{i}$, we can regress $D_{i}$ on $Z_{i}$ and $x_{i}$: $$D_{i} = \lambda + \theta Z_{i} + \kappa x_{i} + \nu,$$
and form prediction $\hat{D}_{i}$.

- **Step 2:** Regress $y_{i}$ on $x_{i}$ and $\hat{D}_{i}$: $$y_{i} = \alpha + \beta x_{i} + \delta \hat{D}_{i} + \xi_{i}$$
:::

---

## Derivation

Recall our first-stage, $S=\theta Z + \varepsilon$, where $\hat{\theta}=\frac{C(Z,S)}{V(Z)}$, or $\hat{\theta}V(Z) = C(Z,S)$. Then:

$$\begin{align}
\hat{\delta}  & = \frac{COV(Y,Z)}{COV(S,Z)} \\
        & = \frac{\hat{\theta}C(Y,Z)}{\hat{\theta}C(S,Z)} = \frac{\hat{\theta}C(Y,Z)}{\hat{\theta}^{2}V(Z)} \\
        & = \frac{C(\hat{\theta}Z,Y)}{V(\hat{\theta}Z)} = \frac{C(\hat{S},Y)}{V(\hat{S})}
\end{align}$$


---

## In regression terms

But in practice, *DON'T* do this in two steps. Why?

::: {.fragment}
Because standard errors are wrong...not accounting for noise in prediction, $\hat{D}_{i}$. The appropriate fix is built into most modern stats programs.
:::


---

## How to do IV in practice

We'll talk about this next class!


# Formal IV Assumptions

---

## Key assumptions

1. *Exclusion:* Instrument is uncorrelated with the error term
2. *Validity:* Instrument is correlated with the endogenous variable
3. *Monotonicity:* Treatment more (less) likely for those with higher (lower) values of the instrument

::: {.fragment}
Assumptions 1 and 2 sometimes grouped into an *only through* condition.
:::

---

## Exclusion

Conley et al (2010) and "plausible exogeneity", union of confidence intervals approach

- Suppose extent of violation is known in $y_{i} = \beta x_{i} + \gamma z_{i} + \varepsilon_{i}$, so that $\gamma = \gamma_{0}$
- IV/TSLS applied to $y_{i} - \gamma_{0}z_{i} = \beta x_{i} + \varepsilon_{i}$ works
- With $\gamma_{0}$ unknown...do this a bunch of times!
    - Pick $\gamma=\gamma^{b}$ for $b=1,...,B$
    - Obtain $(1-\alpha)$ % confidence interval for $\beta$, denoted $CI^{b}(1-\alpha)$
    - Compute final CI as the union of all $CI^{b}$

---

## Exclusion

Kippersluis and Rietveld (2018), "Beyond Plausibly Exogenous"

- "zero-first-stage" test
- Focus on subsample for which your instrument is not correlated with the endogenous variable of interest
    1. Regress the outcome on all covariates and the instruments among this subsample
    2. Coefficient on the instruments captures any potential direct effect of the instruments on the outcome (since the correlation with the endogenous variable is 0 by assumption). 


---

## Validity

Just says that your instrument is correlated with the endogenous variable, but what about the **strength** of the correlation?

---

## Why we care about instrument strength

Recall our schooling and wages equation, $$y = \beta S + \epsilon.$$ Bias in IV can be represented as:

$$Bias_{IV} \approx \frac{Cov(S, \epsilon)}{V(S)} \frac{1}{F+1} = Bias_{OLS} \frac{1}{F+1}$$

- Bias in IV may be close to OLS, depending on instrument strength
- **Bigger problem:** Bias could be bigger than OLS if exclusion restriction not *fully* satisfied


---

## Testing strength of instruments

**Single endogenous variable**

- Stock & Yogo (2005) test based on first-stage F-stat (homoskedasticity only)
    - Critical values in tables, based on number of instruments
    - Rule-of-thumb of 10 with single instrument (higher with more instruments)
    - Lee et al (2022): With first-stage F-stat of 10, standard "95% confidence interval" for second stage is really an 85% confidence interval
    - Over-reliance on "rules of thumb", as seen in [Anders and Kasy (2019)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20180310)


---

## Testing strength of instruments

**Single endogenous variable**

- Stock & Yogo (2005) test based on first-stage F-stat (homoskedasticity only)
- Kleibergen & Paap (2007) Wald statistic
- Effective F-statistic from Olea & Pflueger (2013)


---

## Testing strength of instruments: First-stage

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Single endogenous variable**

1. Homoskedasticity
    - Stock & Yogo, effective F-stat
2. Heteroskedasticity
    - Effective F-stat
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Many endogenous variables**

1. Homoskedasticity
    - Stock & Yogo with Cragg & Donald statistic, Sanderson & Windmeijer (2016), effective F-stat
2. Heteroskedasticity
    - Kleibergen & Papp Wald is robust analog of Cragg & Donald statistic, effective F-stat
:::

::::


---

## Making sense of all of this...

- Test first-stage using effective F-stat (inference is harder and beyond this class)
- Many endogenous variables problematic because strength of instruments for one variable need not imply strength of instruments for others

# Interpretation



---

## Heterogenous TEs

- In constant treatment effects, $Y_{i}(1) - Y_{i}(0) = \delta_{i} = \delta, \text{ } \forall i$
- Heterogeneous effects, $\delta_{i} \neq \delta$
- With IV, what parameter did we just estimate? Need **monotonicity** assumption to answer this


---

## Monotonicity

Assumption: Denote the effect of our instrument on treatment by $\pi_{1i}$. Monotonicity states that $\pi_{1i} \geq 0$ or $\pi_{1i} \leq 0,  \text{ } \forall i$.

- Allows for $\pi_{1i}=0$ (no effect on treatment for some people)
- All those affected by the instrument are affected in the same "direction"
- With heterogeneous ATE and monotonicity assumption, IV provides a "Local Average Treatment Effect" (LATE)

---

## LATE and IV Interpretation

- LATE is the effect of treatment among those affected by the instrument (compliers only).
- Recall original Wald estimator:

$$\delta_{IV} = \frac{E[Y_{i} | Z_{i}=1] - E[Y_{i} | Z_{i}=0]}{E[D_{i} | Z_{i}=1] - E[D_{i} | Z_{i}=0]}=E[Y_{i}(1) - Y_{i}(0) | \text{complier}]$$

- Practically, monotonicity assumes there are no defiers and restricts us to learning only about compliers

---

## Is LATE meaningful?

- Learn about average treatment effect for compliers
- Different estimates for different compliers
    - IV based on merit scholarships
    - IV based on financial aid
    - Same compliers? Probably not

---

## LATE with defiers

- In presence of defiers, IV estimates a weighted difference between effect on compliers and defiers (in general)
- LATE can be restored if subgroup of compliers accounts for the same percentage as defiers and has same LATE
- Offsetting behavior of compliers and defiers, so that remaining compliers dictate LATE
