3. Overview of Medicare Advantage Data
   

# Competition and Pricing

## Big picture

- Question: How do more firms affect market prices?
- From earlier micro:
  - Firms compare marginal revenue (MR) and marginal cost (MC).
  - Market power is the ability to set $p > MC$.
- Guiding idea:
  - When there are more firms, competition is stronger and prices tend to be lower, all else equal.

## Benchmarks from earlier courses

- Perfect competition:
  - Many firms, identical product, free entry.
  - Each firm is a price taker, so $p = MC$ and markups are zero.
- Monopoly:
  - One firm facing the market demand curve.
  - Chooses $q$ so that $MR = MC$, which implies $p > MC$ and a positive markup.
- These two cases give a range:
  - The competitive price is at the low end, the monopoly price is at the high end.

## Oligopoly and number of firms

- Oligopoly: a few firms that interact strategically.
- Examples from intermediate micro:
  - Cournot competition, where firms choose quantities.
  - Bertrand competition, where firms choose prices.
- With homogeneous products:
  - As the number of firms increases, outcomes become closer to perfect competition.
  - Prices move closer to $MC$ as the number of firms grows.

## Differentiated products and markups

- In many markets, products are differentiated by brand, quality, or features.
- Even with Bertrand-style price setting:
  - Each firm faces its own residual demand curve.
  - Demand for each firm is less elastic than demand for the whole market.
  - This allows $p > MC$ and positive markups, even when there are several firms.
- Adding more firms usually:
  - Makes each firm’s demand more elastic.
  - Reduces prices and markups, but prices typically remain above $MC$ because of differentiation.


## Takeaways

- Perfect competition: many firms, $p = MC$, no market power.
- Monopoly: one firm, $p > MC$, strong market power.
- Oligopoly with differentiated products:
  - Firms still choose prices above marginal cost.
  - More firms and lower concentration generally mean lower prices and smaller markups, but not zero markups when products remain differentiated.


## A simple model: more firms, lower price

- Inverse demand: $P(Q) = a - bQ$, with $a > c$ and constant marginal cost $c$.
- There are $n$ identical firms. Firm $i$ chooses $q_i$ to maximize
  $$\pi_i = \big(P(Q) - c\big) q_i = \big(a - b(q_i + Q_{-i}) - c\big) q_i.$$
- In a symmetric Cournot equilibrium, $q_i = q$ for all $i$, so $Q = nq$ and
  $$Q^*(n) = \frac{n(a - c)}{b(n + 1)}, \qquad
  p^*(n) = P(Q^*(n)) = \frac{a + nc}{n + 1}.$$
- As $n$ increases, $p^*(n)$ falls:
  $$\frac{dp^*(n)}{dn} = \frac{c - a}{(n + 1)^2} < 0 \quad \text{when } a > c.$$
- IRL, effect of $n$ will depend on substitutability of products/firms


## Differentiated-products Bertrand: more firms, lower price

- Firm $i$ chooses its price $p_i$ to maximize
  $$\max_{p_i} \ \pi_i(p_i, p_{-i}) = (p_i - c)\, q_i(p_i, p_{-i}).$$
- First-order condition:
  $$\frac{\partial \pi_i}{\partial p_i}
    = q_i(p_i, p_{-i}) + (p_i - c)\frac{\partial q_i}{\partial p_i} = 0.$$
- Define the own-price elasticity of demand
  $$\varepsilon_i = \frac{\partial q_i}{\partial p_i}\frac{p_i}{q_i} < 0.$$
  Rearranging the first-order condition gives the Lerner condition
  $$\frac{p_i - c}{p_i} = -\frac{1}{\varepsilon_i}.$$
- Markup $(p_i - c)/p_i$ falls with the number of firms, assuming entry increases own-price elasticity due to presence of substitutes


## Measuring Competition

Many ways to think about measuring competition:

- Hirfindahl-Hirshman Index (HHI): $\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{i}^{2}$
- Simple count of firms
- Indicators for monopoly, duopoly, triopoly, etc.

# Medicare Advantage

## Very Basic Description...

- Private provision of health insurance for Medicare beneficiaries
- Medicare "replacement" plans

::: {.fragment}
- It's just private insurance for those eligible for Medicare
:::


## Some History

- Existed since 1980s, formalized in the 1990s, expanded in 2000s
- Medicare+Choice as part of Balanced Budget Act in 1997
- Largest expansion: Medicare Modernization Act in 2003 (also brought Medicare Part D)


## Bidding (in the background)

In its current form...

- Insurers submit plan details and a price needed to cover traditional Medicare ("bid")
- If approved, Medicare pays risk-adjusted bid *or* benchmark
- Bid $<$ benchmark, insurer gets a rebate and sets premiums to 0
- Bid $>$ benchmark, insurer charges premium
- Seperate bidding for Part D


## Medicare Advantage in Real Life

Let's take a look at the Medicare Advantage plan options...

## Pricing in MA

- Premiums are relative to standard Medicare Part B premiums
- Many plans listed as \$0 premium 
  - Enrollees stil pay Part B premium (\$185 per month in 2025)

## Insurers, Contracts, Plans...oh my!

Definition of "product" in MA is a little complicated...

- Insurer is the corporate entity like UnitedHealth, Humana, etc.
- Insurers seek approval to offer a "contract"
  - Dictates the type (HMO, PPO, etc.)
  - Sets legal terms of CMS/Insurer relationship, including counties in which contract can be offered (service area)
  - Level of quality measurement (more on this in the next module)
- Within a contract, insurers offer "plans" (i.e., benefit packages)
  - Networks, formularies, covered services
  - Premiums, deductibles, co-insurance, co-payments
  

# Introduction to Medicare Advantage Data

## Overview

- **Tons** of Medicare Advantage data publicly available from CMS
- For this section, we're focused on "pricing" and "competition"
  - Measure competition based on HHI
  - Measure price in two ways: 1) average premiums; and 2) count of positive premiums

## Data Needed

- Enrollment and plan/contract info: enrollment files
- Approved counties and contracts: service area files
- Denominator for market share: penetration files
- Premium data: landscape files (i.e., plan characteristics)

## Data NOT (yet) Needed

- Star ratings
- CMS payment data (rebates)
- Benchmark rates
- CMS FFS costs
